1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because it involves writing and sending a message to another user. Unit tests are more suited for testing smaller individual parts of code ensuring each part works as intended.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because it tests a smaller individual part of code ensuring each part works as intended. It is small scale enough that it alone can be tested for preventing the user from typing more than 80 characters.
